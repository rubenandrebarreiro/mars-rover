# Mars' Rover (An Autonomous Vehicle/Robot which uses Heuristics and Search/Genetic Algorithms)

> A [**_3rd year's project_**](http://www.unl.pt/guia/2018/fct/UNLGI_getCurso?curso=935) of the [**_BSc. degree of Computer Sciences and Engineering_**](https://www.fct.unl.pt/en/education/course/integrated-master-computer-science/) made in [**_FCT NOVA (Faculty of Sciences and Technology of New University of Lisbon)_**](https://www.fct.unl.pt/), in the subject of [**_Artificial Intelligence_**](http://www.unl.pt/guia/2018/fct/UNLGI_getUC?uc=1712). This project was built using [**_Java_**](https://www.java.com/). The scenario chosen for this project was to help an _autonomous vehicle_, most precisely, a **_Rover_**, in the planet _Mars_, to _find_ and _discover_ the _best path to a specify goal_. The terrain of the _Red Planet_, have _critical zones_ and _terrains_, that offer more costly travels, which the **_Rover_** have more difficulty to go through. So, the main idea it's to help this **_Mars' Rover_** to _find the best path to its goal_, using **_Search Algorithms_** with **_heuristics_** and **_costs_** and also, **_Genetic Algorithms_**.
